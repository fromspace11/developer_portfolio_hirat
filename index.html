            <p>You're right, it costs a lot while exploring new things. And that even pays me nothing, still I love to
                explore and test newly anything. To bear that cost, now I'm learning web development. I'll not stop it
                untill I become the Master of Web Development.</p>

            <p>As I choose to learn web development, I've already learned the basic HTML and CSS to build any simple
                website. I can now teach Motu Patlu how to make simple website. By the way, now my goal is to master at
                advanced topics.</p>
