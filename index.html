            <h3>Extreme Adventurer and Explorer</h3>
            <p>Exploring is all about getting out of your comfort zone, venturing into the unknown, sampling new things
                and discovering foreign lands.You're right, it costs a lot while while getting into this. And that even
                pays me nothing, except everything. That's why I love to
                explore and test newly anything. To bear that cost, now I'm learning web development. Though I've
                already learned the basic HTML and CSS to build any simple website. Even I can now teach Motu Patlu how
                to make simple websites. I'll not stop it
                untill I become the Master of Web Development.</p>

            <p>
                Life is not a permanent state. I'll say that it's a testing journey, and we're only travellers. We
                should
                Eat, Explore, Pray, Learn, Live and Leave within this short time. However, we can dream greater before
                we leave and make a difference on this planet. As everything starts from zero. I'm still not over it.
                But I will make some positive impact.
